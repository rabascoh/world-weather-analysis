# World Weather Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels based on user-specified weather preferences. Four cities were selected and a map with directions and a travel itinerary were created. 

For this exercise, cities with maximum temperatures between 70°F - 90°F were selected. 
Of these cities, four were selected in Japan for the map with directions and the travel itinerary: Kamaishi, Hasaki, Katsuura and Wajima.
